# Visualising Homicide Convictions by Sex from 2012 to 2023
### Final assessment for PSY6422
This project looked at visualising homicide convictions between 2012-2023 categorised by sex. My research question for this project was 'Are males or females historically more likely to be convicted of homicide?' From the data analysis and visualisation, we can clearly see males are significantly more likely to be convicted of homicide in the last 10 years.

The raw data for this file was retrieved from an article on the Office for National Statistics website titled "Homicide in England and Wales: year ending March 2023." The raw data is quite interesting as it is comprised of many worksheets with different homicide statistics. I chose to use 'Worksheet 31' in my data analysis and visualisation as it uses the raw conviction numbers for male and female suspects. The worksheet does have percentage data included, however, but this was removed as it was not relevant to my research question.

When editing the column names, I removed notes 65 and 66 ([note 65], [note 66]) from the column names for ease. These notes can be viewed in the "Notes" sheet in the raw dataset. Note 65 refers to the "Age of Suspect" column and means the 'Age of suspect is based on age at time of offence.' Note 66 refers to the "Apr 2020 to Mar 2021" column, as well as the "Total" of all of the ages, and means these rows and columns 'Includes suspect with unknown age'.
